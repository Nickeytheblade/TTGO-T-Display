TT-GO T-DISPLAY ESP32 to make a Wi-Fi Pager 
i used a TT-GO T-DISPLAY ESP32 to make a Pager style look a like Wi-Fi Pager.
It can pull text from pages or API pages setup using Thingspeak , ( or your own ).
i like to follow police traffic Pager communications so i provide its pulling Pager messages from a P2000 pager site , also News and weather messages , it can handle 4 servers setup in the program , could ad more !
Its just handy to put on your desk .

When holding 2 buttons at start it will have AUTO READ .
So if there is a new message it will show it on the screen !
